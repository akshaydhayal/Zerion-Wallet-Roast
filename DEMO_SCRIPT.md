# ðŸ”¥ Wallet Roast - Demo Script (1-2 Minutes)

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hey everyone! I'm excited to present **Wallet Roast** - a fun and entertaining web application that takes a completely different approach to analyzing Solana wallets. Instead of boring analytics dashboards, we decided to roast people based on their on-chain trading behavior."

## Problem & Solution (20 seconds)
"Crypto portfolio trackers are usually dry, complex, and intimidating. We wanted to make wallet analysis accessible, shareable, and hilarious. So we built Wallet Roast - simply enter any Solana wallet address, and our AI generates personalized, savage roasts based on real on-chain data."

## How It Works (30 seconds)
"Here's how it works: Users enter a Solana wallet address - no wallet connection needed, making it super accessible. Our app fetches comprehensive wallet data from the Zerion API, including portfolio value, profit and loss, transaction history, and trading patterns. Then, using AI powered by Google Gemini, we analyze everything from their trading frequency to their worst losses and generate personalized roasts. We also calculate a wallet score and personality type - whether you're a Certified Degen, Diamond Hands, or a Crypto Ghost."

## Key Features (25 seconds)
"The app features two main sections: **Wallet Roast** - where you get hilariously roasted with your personality type and score - and **Wallet Analysis** - a comprehensive breakdown with interactive charts showing your portfolio performance over time, transaction insights, and detailed PnL metrics. Users can share their roasts on Twitter or download them as images, making it perfect for social media."

## Technical Highlights (20 seconds)
"Technically, we're using Next.js 14 with TypeScript, integrated with the Zerion API for all blockchain data including portfolio, positions, transactions, PnL, and balance charts. The frontend uses Framer Motion for smooth animations and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. We've implemented server-side API proxying to handle CORS and ensure secure, reliable data fetching."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"Wallet Roast transforms boring wallet analytics into an entertaining, shareable experience. It's live, fully functional, and ready to roast any Solana wallet. Check it out and prepare to be destroyed! ðŸ”¥"
