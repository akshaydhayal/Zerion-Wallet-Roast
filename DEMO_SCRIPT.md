## 🎯 Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Landing page with animated background]**

"Hey everyone! Welcome to **Wallet Roast** - a fun, social dApp that roasts your Solana wallet based on your actual onchain behavior.

Built for the Colosseum Cypherpunk Hackathon using the **Zerion API**, this app takes your portfolio data, trading history, and PnL, and gives you a hilariously honest assessment of your crypto skills... or lack thereof."

## 🔥 Problem Statement (30 seconds)

**[Show boring portfolio tracker screens]**

"Most crypto analytics tools are dry and boring. Numbers, charts, graphs... yawn. 

We wanted to create something **entertaining** and **shareable** - something that makes checking your wallet actually fun. Because let's be real, if you're down 50%, you might as well laugh about it."

## 💡 Solution Overview (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Show the Hero section]**

"Wallet Roast connects to your Solana wallet and uses the **Zerion API** to fetch:

1. **Portfolio data** - Your total value and holdings
2. **Profit & Loss** - How much you're up or down
3. **Transaction history** - Your trading patterns
4. **Wallet positions** - What tokens you're holding

Then it generates a personalized roast based on your behavior, complete with a personality type, wallet score, and shareable roast card."
