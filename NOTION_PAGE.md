# üî• Wallet Roast - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**Wallet Roast** is an AI-powered web application that transforms boring Solana wallet analytics into an entertaining, shareable experience. Instead of complex dashboards, users enter any Solana wallet address and receive hilarious, personalized roasts based on real on-chain trading behavior, powered by Google Gemini AI and comprehensive data from the Zerion API.

## üéØ The Problem We Solved

Traditional crypto portfolio trackers are dry, intimidating, and lack engagement. Most users find wallet analytics boring and complex. We wanted to make blockchain data accessible, fun, and shareable - creating a social experience around wallet analysis that anyone can enjoy without technical expertise.

## üí° Our Solution

Wallet Roast makes wallet analysis entertaining by combining real blockchain data with AI-powered humor. Users simply paste any Solana wallet address (no wallet connection needed), and our system fetches comprehensive on-chain data including portfolio value, profit and loss, transaction history, and trading patterns. Then, AI generates contextual roasts based on actual wallet behavior - from savage burns for terrible trades to light-hearted jokes about HODL habits.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Personalized Roasts

Our AI analyzes multiple factors to generate unique roasts:
- **Trading Frequency**: Roasts degens for over-trading or ghosts for inactivity
- **Portfolio Performance**: Mocks losses, celebrates gains, judges portfolio size
- **Token Choices**: Burns meme coin holders, respects blue-chip investors
- **Transaction Patterns**: Identifies panic sellers, diamond hands, or reckless traders
